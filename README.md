# üé§ Speech Recognition Projects Collection

This repository contains three comprehensive projects in the domain of speech and audio processing. Each project highlights a critical aspect of building intelligent speech systems using signal processing, deep learning, and real-time inference.

## üìÅ Project 1: Building an End-to-End Speech Recognition Pipeline

**Subtitle:** Signal Processing, Acoustic Modeling, and Performance Evaluation (Feature Extraction)

### Description

This project walks through the full pipeline of a speech recognition system‚Äîfrom raw audio signal to predicted text. It includes detailed steps for feature extraction, acoustic modeling, and evaluating system performance.

### Key Components

* Signal preprocessing (resampling, normalization)
* Feature extraction (MFCCs, Spectrograms)
* Acoustic modeling using HMMs and deep learning
* Word error rate (WER) and accuracy evaluation

### How to Run

```bash
python end_to_end_pipeline.py
```

## üìÅ Project 2: Real-Time Speech-to-Text System for Customer Support Automation

**Subtitle:** Real-Time Speech Recognition and TTS Integration

### Description

A real-time speech-to-text (STT) system built to support customer interaction tasks. This includes live transcription and optional text-to-speech (TTS) output for vocal responses, suitable for automation systems.

### Key Components

* Real-time microphone input using `pyaudio` or `speech_recognition`
* Noise filtering and silence detection
* Live speech transcription using a deep learning model
* Optional TTS feedback using `pyttsx3` or Google TTS

### How to Run

```bash
python real_time_stt_tts.py
```

## üìÅ Project 3: Building a Speech-to-Text Transcription System with Noise Robustness

**Subtitle:** Recorded Audio to Text & Real-Time Speech to Text

### Description

This project focuses on building robust speech-to-text systems that can transcribe both pre-recorded and real-time audio even in noisy conditions.

### Key Components

* Denoising and audio enhancement techniques
* MFCC-based feature extraction
* Acoustic model with noise robustness (e.g., CNN/RNN)
* Two modes:

  * **Recorded Audio Transcription**
  * **Real-Time Microphone Transcription**

### How to Run

For recorded audio:

```bash
python recorded_audio_to_text.py
```

For real-time transcription:

```bash
python realtime_noise_robust_stt.py
```

## üõ† Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Commonly used libraries:

* `librosa`
* `scikit-learn`
* `speech_recognition`
* `tensorflow` / `torch`
* `numpy`
* `pyaudio`, `sounddevice`, `pyttsx3`

## üìå Notes

* Ensure correct dataset paths in scripts (e.g., `C:/Users/user/Downloads/archive`)
* Check microphone permissions for real-time applications
* Tweak noise filters and model thresholds for better real-time accuracy
