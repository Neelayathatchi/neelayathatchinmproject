# Speech Recognition Projects Collection

This repository contains three end-to-end speech recognition projects focused on different aspects of audio processing and transcription:

1. **Digit Recognition from Audio Files**
2. **Recorded Audio to Text using Dataset**
3. **Real-Time Speech-to-Text Transcription System**

Each project demonstrates different methodologies and technologies for speech recognition, including classical signal processing, machine learning, and real-time processing.

## üìÅ Project 1: Digit Recognition from Audio Files

### Description

This project recognizes spoken digits (0-9) from pre-recorded audio samples using the Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD).

### Dataset

* **Path:** `C:/Users/user/Downloads/archive`
* **Dataset:** Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD)

### Key Features

* MFCC feature extraction
* Train/test split
* Classification using traditional machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)

### How to Run

```bash
python digit_recognition.py
```

## üìÅ Project 2: Recorded Audio to Text using Dataset

### Description

A simple pipeline to transcribe recorded speech audio into text using a pre-recorded dataset.

### Dataset

* **Path:** `C:/Users/user/Downloads/archive/cat`
* **Content:** Pre-recorded spoken phrases or sentences

### Key Features

* Audio preprocessing (resampling, normalization)
* Feature extraction (MFCCs)
* Acoustic modeling with a deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN)
* Text decoding

### How to Run

```bash
python recorded_audio_to_text.py
```

## üìÅ Project 3: Real-Time Speech-to-Text Transcription System

### Description

A real-time speech recognition system for customer support automation, capable of capturing microphone input and converting it into text with noise robustness.

### Key Features

* Real-time microphone input using `pyaudio` or `speech_recognition`
* Noise reduction and silence trimming
* Streaming inference using a deep learning-based acoustic model
* Live text transcription display

### How to Run

```bash
python real_time_speech_to_text.py
```

## üõ† Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Common libraries used:

* `librosa`
* `scikit-learn`
* `speech_recognition`
* `tensorflow` / `torch`
* `numpy`
* `pyaudio` or `sounddevice`
